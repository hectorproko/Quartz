# MERN STACK IMPLEMENTATION
A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. Here we will implement a **MERN** which consits of:

 **M**ongoDB - No-SQL database <br>
 **E**xpressJS - A server side Web Application framework for Node.js <br>
 **R**eactJS - A JavaScript based frontend framework used to build User Interface (UI) components <br>
 **N**ode.js - A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

In this project the user interacts with the **ReactJS UI** components (application front-end ) from the browswer. This frontend is served by **ExpressJS** (running on top of **NodeJS**) which is the application backend. Any interaction that causes a data change request is sent to the **NodeJS** based **ExpressJS** server, which grabs data from the **MongoDB** database if required, and returns the data to the frontend of the application, which is then presented to the user.

Technologies/Tools used:
* AWS (EC2)
* Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
* MonogDB
* ExpressJS
* ReactJS
* Node.js
* GitBash
* Postman

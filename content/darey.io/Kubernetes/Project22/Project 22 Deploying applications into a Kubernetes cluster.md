*~~(old [Project 22](https://github.com/hectorproko/DEPLOYING-APPLICATIONS-INTO-KUBERNETES-CLUSTER/blob/main/Project22_Steps.md))~~*

PROJECT 22 showcases the deployment and configuration of an Nginx web server in a Kubernetes cluster. The project involves various steps such as creating a Kubernetes cluster, deploying pods and services, configuring a LoadBalancer, using Deployments and **ReplicaSets**.

## UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT

- The service object in Kubernetes routes traffic to pods.
- The service's type can be ClusterIP, which acts as an internal load balancer.
- The service forwards requests to pods based on their respective selector labels.
- Pods have virtual IP addresses assigned by Kubernetes network plugins.
- Pods can have different IP addresses from the servers they are running on.

<!--
Self Side Task
- Build the Tooling app Dockerfile and push it to Dockerhub registry.
- Write a Pod and a Service manifests to ensure access to the Tooling app's frontend using port-forwarding.
-->

#### Expose a Service on a Server's Public IP Address & Static Port
- NodePort service type exposes the service on a static port on the node's IP address.
- NodePorts are in the range of 30000-32767 by default.
- NodePort allows direct access to the application using the node's public IP address and appended port.
- Inbound traffic to the NodePort range needs to be allowed in the EC2's Security Group.  
*(NodePort is typically used for accessing services from outside the cluster when there is no cloud provider load balancer available)*  

#### Maintaining Desired Number of Pods
- **ReplicaSet** (**RS**) object ensures a stable set of pod replicas running.
- RS guarantees the availability of a specified number of identical pods.

*Note: **ReplicaSets** are recommended over the older ReplicationController (RC) object.*

## COMMON KUBERNETES OBJECTS  

1. **Pod**: A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster. Pods can contain one or more containers that are tightly coupled and share resources.

2. **Namespace**: A Namespace provides a way to group and isolate resources within a cluster. It allows multiple teams or projects to share the same cluster while keeping their resources separate.

3. **ReplicaSet**: A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at all times. It is used to scale and manage the lifecycle of Pods. ReplicaSets are typically managed by higher-level controllers like Deployments.

4. **Deployment**: A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. It manages the creation and scaling of ReplicaSets, making it easier to manage application deployments and updates.

5. **StatefulSet**: A StatefulSet is similar to a ReplicaSet but is used for managing stateful applications. It provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of Pods, making it suitable for applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage.

6. **DaemonSet**: A DaemonSet ensures that a copy of a Pod is running on each node in the cluster. It is useful for running system daemons or agents that need to be present on every node.

7. **Service**: A Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy for accessing them. It provides a stable network endpoint to access the Pods, allowing for load balancing and service discovery.

8. **ConfigMap**: A ConfigMap is used to store configuration data as key-value pairs. It allows you to separate configuration from the container images and make it easier to manage and update configurations.

9. **Volume**: A Volume is used to provide persistent storage for containers in a Pod. It allows data to outlive the lifecycle of individual containers and can be shared between containers within the same Pod.

10. **Job/CronJob**: A Job represents a task or a batch job that runs to completion. It ensures that a specified number of Pods successfully complete their tasks before terminating. CronJob is a type of Job that runs on a schedule.

The common YAML fields for every Kubernetes object include:

- `kind`: Specifies the type of Kubernetes object being created, such as Pod, Deployment, or Service.
- `version`: Indicates the version of the Kubernetes API used to create the resource.
- `metadata`: Provides information about the resource, such as its name, labels, and annotations.
- `spec`: Contains the core information about the resource, defining its desired state. This includes details like container images, number of replicas, environment variables, and volumes.
- `status`: Represents the current status of the object and is updated by Kubernetes after creation. This field is not typically included in the YAML manifest provided by the user.

These fields help define the characteristics and behavior of the Kubernetes objects and guide Kubernetes in managing and maintaining the desired state of the cluster.



## Kubernetes on AWS (EKS)

So following [Getting started with Amazon EKS â€“ AWS Management Console and AWS CLI - Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-console.html)

Once again we will utilize the existing **AWS CLI** setup *(from [Project 15](https://github.com/hectorproko/AWS-CLOUD-SOLUTION-FOR-2-COMPANY-WEBSITES-USING-A-REVERSE-PROXY-TECHNOLOGY/blob/main/Project15_Steps.md))* using sub-account **DevOps**

    "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:199055125796:stack/my-eks-vpc-stack/1fbf1cc0-1842-11ed-b05c-0e1c47e12f6b"
}
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$
```

<!--kube user is for EKS not creating Stack-->

As per [aws documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-console.html)

Create a cluster **IAM** role and attach the required Amazon **EKS** **IAM** managed policy to it. Kubernetes clusters managed by Amazon **EKS** make calls to other AWS services on our behalf to manage the resources that we use with the service.

1. We create file `cluster-role-trust-policy.json`.  
    ```css
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "eks.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```


2. Created the role **myAmazonEKSClusterRole**.  
  `--assume-role-policy-document` is used during role creation to define the trust policy document, which determines who can assume the role.  

```css
    hector@hector-Laptop:~$ aws iam create-role \
    >   --role-name myAmazonEKSClusterRole \
    >   --assume-role-policy-document file://"cluster-role-trust-policy.json"
    {
        "Role": {
            "Path": "/",
            "RoleName": "myAmazonEKSClusterRole",
            "RoleId": "AROAS4WE4FUSEZXBGIH4R",
            "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::199055125796:role/myAmazonEKSClusterRole",
            "CreateDate": "2022-07-26T13:26:57Z",
            "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                "Statement": [
                    {
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Principal": {
                            "Service": "eks.amazonaws.com"
                        },
                        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
```

3. Attach the required Amazon **EKS** managed **IAM** policy (**AmazonEKSClusterPolicy**) to the role (**myAmazonEKSClusterRole**).

    `attach-role-policy` is used to attach an **IAM** policy to an existing role, granting permissions and actions to the role.  

    ```css
    hector@hector-Laptop:~$ aws iam attach-role-policy \
    >   --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSClusterPolicy \
    >   --role-name myAmazonEKSClusterRole
    hector@hector-Laptop:~$
    ```

**Configuring Computer to Communicate with Kubernetes Cluster**  

- Deleted the existing kubeconfig file located at `~/.kube/config` to make way for a new configuration.  

- This **AWS CLI** command is used to update the kubeconfig file with the necessary configuration for accessing the **EKS** cluster named "Project22" in the AWS region "us-east-1". The --profile option specifies the AWS profile to use for authentication and authorization.  
  ``` css
  hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --profile kube --region us-east-1 --name Project22
  Added new context arn:aws:eks:us-east-1:199055125796:cluster/Project22 to /home/hector/.kube/config
  ```

- This kubectl command is used to retrieve information about the Kubernetes cluster. It provides details such as the URL of the Kubernetes control plane and the URL of CoreDNS, which is responsible for DNS resolution within the cluster.
  ``` css
  hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl cluster-info
  Kubernetes control plane is running at https://522B9ADEF131F42CC77EB11C3FB33A42.gr7.us-east-1.eks.amazonaws.com
  CoreDNS is running at https://522B9ADEF131F42CC77EB11C3FB33A42.gr7.us-east-1.eks.amazonaws.com/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

  To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

- I attempted to create a **Pod** in the Kubernetes cluster, the **Pod** remained in the "Pending" state.   
*(In Kubernetes, a "Pending" status means that the **Pod** has been scheduled to run on a node but is waiting for the necessary resources, such as CPU and memory, to become available)*  

- The cause was that the cluster had no active worker nodes available to schedule  and run Pods.  
*(Worker nodes are responsible for executing and hosting Pods in a Kubernetes cluster)*

- To address the problem, I had to create a **Node group**.  
  (**Node group**s are a way to provision and manage worker nodes in an Amazon **EKS** cluster. By creating a **Node group**, we added worker nodes to the cluster, providing the necessary resources for Pods to be scheduled and run)

## ACCESSING THE APP FROM THE BROWSER

Let's create a **Pod** named **nginx-pod** by defining a YAML manifest on master node.  

```css
sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee ./nginx-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx:latest
    name: nginx-pod
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
EOF
```
We should have a YAML file named nginx-pod.yaml with the necessary specifications for the **Pod**. It defines a single container running the latest version of the nginx image, named **nginx-pod**. Port 80 is exposed using the TCP protocol.

To create the **Pod** we apply the manifest using `kubectl`  
```css
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
pod/nginx-pod created <<< output
```

To verify the status of the running Pods in the cluster `kubectl get pods`
```css
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-pod   1/1     Running   0          19m
```


<!--
We use **kubectl** to create a new Pod named "curl" and allocate an interactive shell within the container to run the `curl` command inside the container to perform a `GET` request to verify that the nginx service is up and running properly

*Assuming that the requirement is to access the Nginx **Pod** internally, using the Podâ€™s IP address directly is not a reliable choice because Pods are ephemeral. They are not designed to run forever. When they die and another **Pod** is brought back up, the IP address will change and any application that is using the previous IP address directly will break.*  
*To solve this problem, kubernetes uses **Service** â€“ An object that abstracts the underlining IP addresses of Pods. A service can serve as a load balancer, and a reverse proxy which basically takes the request using a human readable DNS name, resolves to a **Pod** IP that is running and forwards the request to it. This way, we do not need to use an IP address. Rather, we can simply refer to the service name directly.*


Since we want to provide access to the **Nginx Pod** from the outside world, such as a web browser, we create a **Service**.

1. Create a Service `yaml` manifest file `nginx-service.yaml`


``` css
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ cat nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx-pod
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

Apply the manifest using the `kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml` command. This creates the **Service** in the Kubernetes cluster.
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
service/nginx-service created
```

To verify that the **Service** is created, run `kubectl get service` command. This will list the Services in our cluster, including the newly created nginx-service.
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get service
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes      ClusterIP   10.100.0.1     <none>        443/TCP   56m
nginx-service   ClusterIP   10.100.15.31   <none>        80/TCP    64s
```
*(The output will show the CLUSTER-IP, PORT(S), and other information about the **Service**. Note that the EXTERNAL-IP is \<none> at this stage, indicating that the **Service** is not yet externally accessible)*  

Attempting to port forward using `kubectl port-forward` command to forward traffic from local port 8089 to port 80 of the nginx-service results in a timeout error. This error occurs because the **Pod** associated with the **Service** does not have the necessary labels for the **Service** to select it.
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl port-forward svc/nginx-service 8089:80
error: timed out waiting for the condition
```

To establish the required connection, we need to modify the **Pod** manifest to include **labels** that align with the **selectors** specified in the **Service** manifest.

1. Deleted the existing **Pod** to start fresh `kubectl delete pod nginx-pod`
2. Updated the YAML manifest file of the pod `nginx-pod.yaml` with the necessary changes (added labels)
    ``` css
    hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ cat nginx-pod.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-pod
      labels:
        app: nginx-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:latest
        name: nginx-pod
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
    ```

3. Applied the updated manifest file creating a new pod 
    ```css
    hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
    pod/nginx-pod created
    ```

This output signifies that now the port forwarding is functioning correctly. Requests made to `127.0.0.1:8089` or `[::1]:8089` on our local machine will be redirected to port 80 of the Nginx service.  
```css
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl  port-forward svc/nginx-service 8089:80
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8089 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8089 -> 80
Handling connection for 8089
Handling connection for 8089
```



When we execute the command `lynx 127.0.0.1:8089`, the Nginx web page will appear in the lynx text-based web browser. This confirms that we can now access the Nginx service running on the **Pod** through the forwarded port.

## CREATE A REPLICA SET

Let us create a **rs.yaml** manifest for a **ReplicaSet** object. **ReplicaSet** (**RS**) object ensures a stable set of pod replicas running

```css
# Part 1
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-pod
# Part 2
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-pod
      labels:
        app: nginx-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:latest
        name: nginx-pod
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP

```

The **ReplicaSet** named **nginx-rs** was created successfully.  
```css
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl apply -f rs.yaml
replicaset.apps/nginx-rs created
```
Listed the pods using `kubectl get pods` command. It shows the status of the existing pods, including nginx-pod and the pods managed by the **ReplicaSet** (**nginx-rs-6qshv** and **nginx-rs-ch9tp**).  
``` css
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get pods
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-pod        1/1     Running   0          49m
nginx-rs-6qshv   1/1     Running   0          17m
nginx-rs-ch9tp   1/1     Running   0          17m
```

Deleting one of the **ReplicaSet** pods **nginx-rs-ch9tp** 
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl delete pod nginx-rs-ch9tp
pod "nginx-rs-ch9tp" deleted
```

Listing the pods it shows that a new **ReplicaSet** pod **nginx-rs-tqvs8** was created to maintain the desired number of replicas.  
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get pods
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-pod        1/1     Running   0          50m
nginx-rs-6qshv   1/1     Running   0          18m
nginx-rs-tqvs8   1/1     Running   0          21s
```

Listing the **ReplicaSets** shows **nginx-rs** with the desired, current, and ready replicas set to 3. 
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get rs -o wide

**Scaling the ReplicaSet:** We can use the **imperative** command `kubectl scale` to scale up the **ReplicaSet** named **nginx-rs** to have 5 replicas.  

``` css
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl scale rs nginx-rs --replicas=5
replicaset.apps/nginx-rs scaled
```

There are now a total of 5 pods running, including the original nginx-pod and the newly created pods by the **ReplicaSet**.
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get pods
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-pod        1/1     Running   0          54m
nginx-rs-6qshv   1/1     Running   0          23m

nginx-rs-tqvs8   1/1     Running   0          5m6s
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$
```
The **ReplicaSet** name **nginx-rs** has been scaled to have 5 replicas.
``` css
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get rs
NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-rs   5         5         5       29m
```

Deleting previous **ReplicaSet**
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl delete rs nginx-rs
replicaset.apps "nginx-rs" deleted
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$
```

The new **ReplicaSet** manifest `rs2.yaml` introduces more advanced label selection and customization options.
``` css
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ cat rs2.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      env: prod
    matchExpressions:
    - { key: tier, operator: In, values: [frontend] }
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        env: prod
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
```

The new **ReplicaSet** `nginx-rs` with the advanced label selection and customization options has been created.  
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl apply -f rs2.yaml
replicaset.apps/nginx-rs created
```

The **ReplicaSet** `nginx-rs` now has a desired replica count of 3, and all replicas are running and ready. The selector specifies that the replicas should have labels matching `env=prod` and `tier=frontend`.  
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get rs nginx-rs -o wide
NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE   CONTAINERS        IMAGES         SELECTOR

```


## USING AWS LOAD BALANCER TO ACCESS OUR SERVICE IN KUBERNETES.

We previously used the ClusterIP service type to access the Nginx service internally. Now, we'll switch to the LoadBalancer service type, which creates an actual load balancer in AWS. This allows us to expose the Nginx service to the external world and benefit from load balancing capabilities provided by the external load balancer. <br>

New service manifest using the LoadBalancer type:  
``` css
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ cat nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    tier: frontend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

Applying the manifest to create the service:  
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
service/nginx-service configured
```

Retrieving information about the service shows it is of type LoadBalancer:  
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get service nginx-service
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP                                                              PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-service   LoadBalancer   10.100.15.31   a0e08a526ccb04426acb64895c03dc0d-651336585.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com   80:30466/TCP   95m
```

If we navigate to the AWS console, we can confirm that the Load Balancer was created along with associated tags.

</details>

*A clusterIP key is updated in the manifest and assigned an IP address. Even though we have specified a Loadbalancer service type, internally it still requires a clusterIP to route the external traffic through.*

*In the ports section, nodePort is still used. This is because Kubernetes still needs to use a dedicated port on the worker node to route the traffic through. Ensure that port range 30000-32767 is opened in our inbound Security Group configuration.*


Using the DNS name of the load balancer `a0e08a526ccb04426acb64895c03dc0d-651336585.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`, I tested the service by accessing it in a web browser.

## USING DEPLOYMENT CONTROLLERS

Officially, it is highly recommended to use Deployments to manage replica sets rather than using replica sets directly.  

A Deployment is another layer above **ReplicaSets** and Pods, newer and more advanced level concept than **ReplicaSets**. It manages the deployment of **ReplicaSets** and allows for easy updating of a **ReplicaSet** as well as the ability to roll back to a previous version of deployment. It is declarative and can be used for rolling updates of micro-services, ensuring there is no downtime.  

<!--
If I scale to 15 with the name of the replicate set, it is brought down to 3, because the replicaset was a result of a deployment and the demployment is set to 3, so terminates untils it goes down to 3
-->

<details close>
<summary>In this series of commands, we demonstrate the behavior of a Kubernetes Deployment and its associated ReplicaSet.</summary>

``` css
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl delete rs nginx-rs
replicaset.apps "nginx-rs" deleted
```
Initially, we created a Deployment, specifying 3 replicas of a pod running the nginx container. This Deployment automatically created a **ReplicaSet** to manage these pods, maintaining the desired state of 3 active nginx pods
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ cat deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8
```
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
```
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get deployment
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           20s
```
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get rs
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf   3         3         3       32s
```
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-4m86n   1/1     Running   0          44s
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-8rrkf   1/1     Running   0          44s
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-p8w6q   1/1     Running   0          44s
```

Later, we attempted to manually scale the **ReplicaSet** to 15 replicas using the `kubectl scale` command. However, as the **ReplicaSet** is managed by a Deployment, the Deployment immediately noticed this change and reverted it back to the desired state of 3 replicas. This was evident from the 'Terminating' status of the additional pods.
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl scale rs nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf --replicas=15
replicaset.apps/nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf scaled
```
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-4m86n   1/1     Running       0          2m16s
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-87bqs   1/1     Terminating   0          6s

nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-mcwjr   1/1     Terminating   0          6s
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-p8w6q   1/1     Running       0          2m16s
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-pr2lf   1/1     Terminating   0          6s
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-qjhrl   1/1     Terminating   0          6s
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-wvlzn   1/1     Terminating   0          6s
```
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-4m86n   1/1     Running   0          2m41s
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-8rrkf   1/1     Running   0          2m41s
nginx-deployment-5cb44ffccf-p8w6q   1/1     Running   0          2m41s
```
```
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get deployment
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           5m52s
```

This exercise essentially illustrates the declarative nature of Deployments in Kubernetes. When a **ReplicaSet** is managed by a Deployment, the Deployment ensures that the desired state is preserved. Any manual changes to the **ReplicaSet** are overridden by the Deployment to maintain the state defined in the Deployment specification.

## PERSISTING DATA FOR PODS
*(In [Project 23](https://github.com/hectorproko/PERSISTING-DATA-IN-KUBERNETES/blob/main/Project23_Steps.md), we demonstrate how to persist data)*  

When a **Pod** is deleted in Kubernetes, any data stored within that **Pod**'s container is lost. Pods in Kubernetes are **ephemeral**, meaning they can be created, deleted, and replaced dynamically. This behavior is intentional to ensure scalability, fault-tolerance, and efficient resource utilization.

First we Scale the Pods down to 1 replica.
``` css
hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get deployment
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           20m

hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl autoscale deployment nginx-deployment --max=1 --min=1
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/nginx-deployment autoscaled

hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get deployment
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           21m

hector@hector-Laptop:~/Project22$ kubectl get deployment
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   1/1     1            1           21m
```

Confirming that we currently have only one pod running.
```

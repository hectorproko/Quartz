# Devops-Tooling-Website-Solution
Implementing a web solution where several stateless Web Servers share a common database and also access the same files using **Network File System** (NFS) as a shared file storage. Even though the **NFS** server might be located on a completely separate hardware – for Web Servers it look like a local file system from where they can serve the same files.

Technologies/Tools used:

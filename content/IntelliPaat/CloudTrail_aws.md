## Lecture 10 â€“ CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that enables operational and risk auditing, governance, and compliance for your AWS account. Events in CloudTrail are actions taken by a user, role, or AWS service. Events include AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs actions.

Benefits
- Improves your security posture by recording user activity and events, and set up automated workflow rules with Amazon EventBridge.
- Protects your organization from penalties using CloudTrail logs to prove compliance with regulations such as [[SOC (System and Organization Controls)|SOC]], PCI, and HIPAA.
- Captures and consolidate user activity and API usage across AWS Regions and accounts on a single, centrally controlled platform.

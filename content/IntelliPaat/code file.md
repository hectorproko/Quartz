"A digital file that contains a set of instructions written in a programming or scripting language, intended for execution by a computer or software interpreter."

This encompasses source code files in various programming languages (like `.py` for Python, `.js` for JavaScript, or `.java` for Java), as well as scripting files, configuration files, and other types of files that contain code-like instructions for various systems and applications.

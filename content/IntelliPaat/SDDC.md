 Software-Defined Data Center

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Example: AWS</mark>

- This is a data center where all infrastructure is virtualized and delivered as a service. It includes compute, storage, and networking resources all controlled by software.
- The main advantage of an SDDC is agility and flexibility. Because resources are managed by software, it's easier to automate, orchestrate, and scale the infrastructure based on the needs of applications and workloads.
- VMware is one of the primary vendors associated with the SDDC concept, but many other vendors offer SDDC solutions as well.

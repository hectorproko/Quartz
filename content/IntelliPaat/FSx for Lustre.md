# Use Cases


[[ML (Machine Learning)]] 
workloads use massive amounts of training data. Multiple instances need to process this training data simultaneously, so a shared file storage is very helpful

Media Processing and Transcoding:
Media workflows, such as video rendering and visual effects, need compute and storage resources to handle the massive amounts of data being created

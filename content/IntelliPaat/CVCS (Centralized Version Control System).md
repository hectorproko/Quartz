# Example 
[[SVN]]

# Centralized Version Control System

- Needs a dedicated internet connection for every operation
- Developers just have the working copy and no version history on their local drive
- Committing and retrieving action is slower since it happens on the internet
- Good for storing large files, since version history is not downloaded
- Not dependent on the number of commits

# Disadvantages

- Constantly needs an Internet Connection for any operation
- Version History is not downloaded or maintained on the local system
- Slower than [[DVCS (Distributed Version Control System)|DVCS]], since requires internet for every operation 
- Conflicts have to be resolved manually

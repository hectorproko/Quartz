# Example
[[Git]], [[perforce]], [[mercurial]]
# Distributed Version Control System
- Everything except pushing and pulling can be done without Internet Connection
- Every Developer has full version history on local hard drive
- Committing and retrieving action is faster since data is on local drive
- Not Good for storing large files which are binary in nature, this would increase the repo size at every commit
- If a project has a lot of commits, downloading them may take a lot of time

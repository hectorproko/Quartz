**SDS (Software-Defined Storage)**:
    
- SDS refers to the abstraction of storage services from the underlying storage hardware. Essentially, the control plane of storage (where data is stored, features like deduplication, snapshots, etc.) is separated from the data plane (the actual reading and writing of data to disks).
- With SDS, storage resources can be pooled across different devices and types of storage media, providing flexibility and scalability.
- This approach allows for automatic provisioning, more efficient use of storage resources, and easier management. There are many SDS products in the market, from vendors like Dell EMC, NetApp, and more.

## Module 4 - Ansible

### Module Agenda
### Lecture 1 – What Is Ansible

- Ansible is an open-source configuration management tool
- Used for configuration management
- Can solve wide range of automation challenges
- Written by [[Michael DeHaan]]
- Named after a fictional communication device, first used by Ursula K. LeGuin in her novel Rocannon's World in 1966
- In 2015, Red Hat acquired Ansible

### Lecture 2 – Why Ansible?
Need to learn [[Puppet]] don't wan to rely only on one. No some much with [[Chef]]

#### Advantages of Ansible
- Easy to learn
- Written in Python
- Easy installation and configuration steps
- No need to install ansible on slave *(just need python)*
- Highly scalable

### Lecture 3 – How Does Ansible Work?

With the help of [[Ansible Playbook]]s, which are written in a very simple language, [[YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)|YAML]]
### Lecture 4 – Ansible Architecture

![[Ansible Modules|Modules]]

![[Basic Ansible Architecture|1000]]
[[Basic Ansible Architecture.canvas|Also one in canvas:]]


### Lecture 5 – NASA Case Study

### Lecture 6 – Install Ansible On AWS

1. Install Ansible on Master
2. Configure SSH access to [[Ansible Host|Ansible Host]]
3. Setting up [[Ansible Host]] and testing connection

He mention [[ssh (Secure Shell)]]

We edited [[path_etc_ansible_hosts.png]]

and tested connection using module ping
```python
ansible -m ping all
#specify group
ansible -m ping production
#using host name
ansible -m ping slave1
```

### Lecture 7 – Creating Ansible Playbooks

[[Ansible playbook]]

![[Ansible Playbook Structure]]

![[Ansible Playbook-Example]]

#### Syntax-check 
`ansible-playbook <playbook>`

```bash
ansible-playbook first_playbook.yml --syntax-check

```

#### Execute ansible playbook 
`ansible-playbook <playbook>`

```bash
sudo ansible-playbook first_playbook.yml
```

## Module 8 - Terraform

### Lecture 1 – What Is Infrastructure As Code (IaC)?
[[IaC (Infrastructure as Code)]] is the management of **infrastructure** (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code. Infrastructure as Code evolved to solve the problem of environment drift in the release pipeline.

Lecture 2 - Infrastructure As Code Vs [[Configuration Management]]

[[IaC (Infrastructure as Code)]]
1. Can create / destroy hardware architectures
2. Can install software while bootstrapping servers *(while creatin hardware)*
3. Should not be used as a replacement to [[Configuration Management|CM tools]]

[[Configuration Management]]
1. Works only with softwares
2. Cannot work on hardware level, but can install any software
3. Cannot be used as a replacement to Iac tools

### Lecture 3 -Introduction To Terraform
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by [[HashiCorp]]. It enables users to define and provision a datacenter infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as Hashicorp Configuration Language, or optionally [[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)]].

### Lecture 4 -Installing Terraform For AWS

Went to terraform.io
Mention how to launch and connect to EC2 to install terraform. Mention [[PuTTY]]

```bash
curl -O <URL to 64Bit Linux Download>
unzip terraform.zip
mv terraform /usr/local/bin
terraform --version
```

### Lecture 5 -Basic Terraform Operations

Create a Folder

main.tf to specify the cloud you going to work with 
```bash
provider "aws"{
region = "us-east-1"
}

```

Initialized that folder `terraform init` with `main.tf`  inside. This donwloads the plugins for the provider to the folder to know how to talk to aws.
Need to specify IAM user with enough permissions

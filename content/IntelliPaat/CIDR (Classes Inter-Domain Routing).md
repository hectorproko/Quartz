At its core, CIDR uses a notation to represent a range of IP addresses by combining an IP address with a slash ('/') followed by a subnet mask length, indicating which portion of the address specifies the network and which portion can be used for hosts within that network.

Instead of using IP classes that wasted IPs, this way you were more efficient

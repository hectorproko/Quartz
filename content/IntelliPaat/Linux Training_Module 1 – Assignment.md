> **Problem Statement:** 
> You are assigned a task to install a web server, in order to control multiple worker processes from one master process. After you've done your research you found out that NGINX is the best suitable option in this scenario. Update the host system and install NGINX. Check the version installed.

This will update the list of available packages and their versions, then upgrade the currently installed packages to their latest versions.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**SDN (Software-Defined Networking)**:
#chat
- SDN refers to the decoupling of the network control plane from the forwarding plane. Traditional networking hardware, like switches and routers, combine these planes, meaning the device determines how to forward traffic based on built-in protocols.
- With SDN, the control plane is centralized in a controller. This allows for a more flexible and programmable network, as the controller can dynamically adjust how traffic is forwarded based on a variety of factors.
- This results in benefits such as more efficient traffic management, better network visibility, and the ability to implement policies consistently across the entire network. Companies like Cisco, Juniper, and OpenFlow have SDN solutions.

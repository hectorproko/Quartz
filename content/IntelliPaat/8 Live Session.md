[[cloud service models]] we already have [[Cloud Computing Models]]
> [!attention]- explanation to decide what to keep
> 
> Both terms, "cloud service models" and "cloud computing models," are used in the industry, but they may imply slightly different scopes. Let's break it down:
> 
> 1. **Cloud Service Models**: This term specifically refers to the types of services offered in the cloud, such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. It emphasizes the service nature and delivery model of these offerings. When someone talks about "cloud service models," they are generally referring to the differentiation between infrastructure, platform, and software services delivered via the cloud.
>     
> 2. **Cloud Computing Models**: This term has a broader scope. While it can encompass IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, it can also include other computing models related to cloud architecture, deployment, and operation. Examples include public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and multi-cloud. In this context, "cloud computing models" might refer to both the service type (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and the deployment model (public, private, hybrid).
>     
> 
> In essence, "cloud service models" is a more specific term focused on the service layer, while "cloud computing models" is broader.
> 
> If you are specifically discussing IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, then "cloud service models" is more appropriate and precise. If you are discussing a mix of service offerings and deployment architectures, then "cloud computing models" might be more fitting.

### Cloud Computing
1 server hosting application, is not cloud computing, is a form of cloud

Characteristics:
1. On-demand self service - provision/terminate using GUI/CLI
2. Board network Access - access over the internet, on any device, ablet o lunch your application in any place
3. Resource Pooling - economics of scale, cheapaer service
4. Rapid elasticity - scale up and scale down in response to system load
5. Measured service - resource uses are measured, monitored controlled and reported, pay what you consume


Public cloud - resources are managed by service provider
Private cloud - Cloud resources are used exclusively by a single organization.

## Lecture 9 – Policy Simulator And EventBridge

The Identity and Access Management (IAM) Policy Simulator is a tool that allows you to simulate permission behavior before actually implementing it.
[[Identity-based policies]], [[IAM permissions boundaries]], Organizations [[SCP (Service Control Policy)|SCPs (Service Control policies)]], and resource-based policies can all be tested and troubleshooted using the IAM policy simulator.

The simulator assesses the policies you select and determines the effective permissions for each of the actions you specify. The simulator employs the same policy evaluation engine as real-world requests to AWS services.

Benefits
- **Agility for Developers**: Developers can quickly test various permissions without implementing them, saving time and effort.
- **Application Monitoring & Auditing**: The simulator allows you to tweak existing policies and see how they would behave.
- **SaaS Integration**: The simulator enables easy integration with other software services.
- AI/ML to personalize SaaS

CloudWatch events (EventBridge)

Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it simple to connect applications using data from your own applications, SaaS applications, and AWS services.

##### How Does It Work?

1. Any changes or triggers in your alarm are conveyed to Event Bridge.
2. You can set rules in Event Bridge to take specific actions based on these events, like sending notifications.

> [!NOTE]
> Certainly, based on your provided transcript, here's a simplified set of steps for replicating the IAM Policy Simulator demo. This will help you understand how to use AWS's IAM Policy Simulator to test permissions for IAM users, groups, or roles.
> 
> ### Steps to Access and Use IAM Policy Simulator:
> 
> #### Access IAM Policy Simulator
> 
> 1. Open your web browser and search for "AWS IAM Policy Simulator."
> 2. Click on the first link that comes up to go to the IAM Policy Simulator.
> 3. You should now see the IAM Policy Simulator interface.
> 
> #### Understand the Basics
> 
> 4. Recognize that the simulator allows you to test the effects of policies attached to IAM entities (users, groups, roles) within your AWS account without making changes in the live environment.
> 
> #### Locate Users and Compare
> 
> 5. Navigate to the "Users" section within IAM (or wherever you manage IAM entities).
> 6. Notice that the same users are also available in the IAM Policy Simulator.
> 
> #### Select a User to Test
> 
> 7. In the IAM Policy Simulator, select a user (e.g., `User1`).
> 8. Observe existing permissions if any (e.g., `S3 full access`, `EC2 full access`).
> 
> #### Run Simulation for Specific AWS Services
> 
> 9. Select a service (e.g., `EC2`) from the dropdown menu.
> 10. Choose specific actions you want to test (e.g., `create subnet`, `create snapshot`).
> 11. Run the simulation.
> 
> #### Analyze Results
> 
> 12. Examine the results to see if the actions are allowed or denied based on the current policies.
> 
> #### Test for Admin Access
> 
> 13. Repeat the above steps for a user with full admin access and observe the simulation allows all permissions.
> 
> #### Create and Test New Policies
> 
> 14. In the IAM Policy Simulator, create new hypothetical policies.
> 15. Attach these new policies to the selected user and run the simulation again to test.
> 
> #### Understand Permission Boundaries
> 
> 16. For a user with a permission boundary (e.g., limiting `EC2 full access`), run the simulation.
>     
> 17. Observe how the permission boundary affects the simulation result, even if the user has broader permissions like `EC2 full access`.
>     
> 18. Thank the audience for watching and encourage them to try it out for themselves.
>     
> 
> This should give you a straightforward way to replicate the IAM Policy Simulator demo based on the transcript you provided.

- Waterfall Model was among the first development models which followed [[SDLC]]
- The Waterfall model follows a linear sequential model of development 
    **i.e** until the first stage is not finished, the next stage will not start

# Advantages
- Clear Objectives
- Specific Deadlines
- No ambiguous requirements
- Well understood milestones
- Process and results are well documented
# Disadvantages
- Working Product is not available until the later stage in lifecycle
- Poor model for large and complex projects
- Cannot accommodate changing requirements
- High risk and uncertainty

Summarizing:
Problem with Waterfall Model was, the development lifecycle took a lot of time to complete. Therefore, by the time finished product was delivered, the customer requirements were no longer the same.

This problem was fixed by [[Lean Model|Lean]] and [[Agile Model|Agile]] methodologies. These methodologies strictly focused on customer feedback and improving the software quality that too in a shorter development lifecycle

- To overcome the [[Waterfall Model#Disadvantages|challenges faced in the Waterfall Model]], we came up with the Agile Methodology
- Agile Method believes in creating shorter development lifecycles
- Shorter Development Lifecycles are achieved by not releasing all the features at once by following an incremental model of development

# Advantages
- Customer Satisfaction is high
- Less Planning Required (features are small, not the whole thing)
- Requirements can dynamic in nature
- Functionality can be created and tested quickly

# Disadvantages
- Not suitable for handling complex dependencies in projects 
    *(if the new feature requires a new skill or license that can stop the process, in [[Waterfall Model]] the requirement don't change so you don't run into this)*
- Knowledge transfer to colleagues can be difficult since there is little documentation (not time for doc, )
- Success of the project depends heavily on customer interaction

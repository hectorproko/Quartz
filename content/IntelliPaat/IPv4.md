An IP address is a 32-bit dynamic address of a node in the network. An IPv4 address has 4 octets of 8-bit each with each number with a value up to 255.


# Classes
IPv4 classes are differentiated based on the number of hosts it supports on the network. There are five types of IPv4 classes and are based on the first octet of IP addresses which are classified as Class A, B, C, D, or E.

| IPv4 Class | IPv4 Start Address | IPv4 End Address   | Usage                              |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| A          | 0.0.0.0            | 127.255.255.255    | Used for Large Network             |
| B          | 128.0.0.0          | 191.255.255.255    | Used for Medium Size Network       |
| C          | 192.0.0.0          | 223.255.255.255    | Used for Local Area Network        |
| D          | 224.0.0.0          | 239.255.255.255    | Reserved for Multicasting          |
| E          | 240.0.0.0          | 255.255.255.254    | Study and R&D                      |


# Private Address
**Private Address:** For each class, there are specific IPs that are reserved specifically for private use only. This IP address cannot be used for devices on the Internet as they are non-routable.

| IPv4 Class | Private IPv4 Start Address | Private IPv4 End Address |
|------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| A          | 10.0.0.0                   | 10.255.255.255           |
| B          | 172.16.0.0                 | 172.31.255.255           |
| C          | 192.168.0.0                | 192.168.255.255          |



# Special IP addresses
**Special Address:** IP Range from 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255 are network testing addresses also known as loopback addresses are the special IP address.

%%[[Create Windows VM in Azure]]%%

### Step 1: Create a Windows VM in the West US Region

1. **I Log into the Azure Portal**:
    
    - I open a web browser and navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). I sign in with my credentials.
2. **I Navigate to Virtual Machines**:
    
    - In the Azure Portal, I select "Virtual machines" from the menu or search for it in the search bar.
3. **I Create the VM**:
    
    - I click on "Create" to start the process of creating a new virtual machine.
    - In the "Basics" tab, I select the appropriate subscription and resource group (or create a new resource group if necessary).
    - I enter a name for my VM.
    - Under "Region", I select "West US".
    - In the "Image" dropdown, I choose a Windows-based image (such as Windows 10 Pro or Windows Server 2019).

### Step 2: Configure the VM

1. **I Choose the VM Size**:
    
    - I select the size for the VM. A size like B1s.
2. **I Set Up Authentication**:
    
    - Under the "Administrator account" section, I choose a username and a strong password that I will use to log in to the VM.
      %%azureuser YourPassword!%%
3. **I Configure Ports**:
    
    - In the "Public inbound ports" section, I choose to allow selected ports and ensure that "RDP (3389)" is checked to allow Remote Desktop connections to the VM.


### Step 3: Review and Create the VM

1. **I Review the Configuration**:
    - I go through the remaining settings and adjust them as necessary (such as networking, management, advanced settings, etc.).
    - Once I'm satisfied with the configuration, I click "Review + create", and then "Create" to deploy the VM.

### Step 4: Connect to the VM Using Windows Remote Desktop

1. **I Obtain the VM's IP Address**:
    
    - Once the VM is deployed, I go to the VM's overview page in the Azure Portal.
    - I find the public IP address of the VM displayed on this page.

3. **I Start the Remote Session**:
    
    - After entering my credentials, I may receive a warning about the certificate of the VM. As this is expected, I click "Yes" or "Continue" to proceed.
    - The Remote Desktop window opens, showing the desktop of the Windows VM.

> [!info] Module 4: Assignment - 5
> **Tasks To Be Performed:** 
> 1. Deploy a VM from the previously created image 
> 2. Open port 80 in NSG 
> 3. Start the Apache2 service in the VM 
> 4. Verify if you are able to access the website 

To create the VM, I referred to [[Assignment 1_Module4_Azure Administrator Course for AZ-103 AZ-104|Assignment 1: Module 4]], ensuring that I selected the image I created in [[Assignment 4_Module4_Azure Administrator Course for AZ-103 AZ-104|Assignment 4: Module 4]] and that I opened Port 80.

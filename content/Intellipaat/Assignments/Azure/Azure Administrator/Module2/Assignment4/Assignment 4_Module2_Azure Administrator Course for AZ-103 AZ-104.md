**Project Showcase: Implementing Azure CDN with Blob Storage!** In a recent project for my Azure Administrator course, I demonstrated the integration of Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) with Azure Blob Storage. The task involved creating a storage account, uploading files to Blob storage, setting up a CDN profile, and connecting it to the Blob to access the uploaded files. This project allowed me to explore the efficiency of Azure CDN in delivering content globally and its seamless integration with Azure Storage solutions. Successfully completing this task enhanced my understanding of Azure's capabilities in optimizing content delivery and storage management in a cloud environment.

> **Tasks To Be Performed:** 
> 1. Create a Storage account, and upload some files in Blob storage 
> 2. Create a CDN profile 
> 3. Create an endpoint and connect to the Azure Blob to access the files uploaded

### Step 1: Create a Storage Account and Upload Files to Blob Storage

1. **I'll re-use a Storage Account**:
    - In the Azure Portal, I navigate to "Storage accounts" and select  `hectorstorage12345` (used in [[Assignment 3_Module2_Azure Administrator Course for AZ-103 AZ-104|Assignment 3]]) from the list of available storage accounts.

2. **I Upload Files to Blob Storage**:
    
    - I open the storage account and navigate to the "Blobs" section.
    - I create a new container by clicking "+ Container". I provide a name `mycontainer` and set the public access level "[[azure container access level blob.png|Blob]]".
    - After creating the container, I open it and click "Upload" to upload files from my computer to the Blob container.

### Step 2: Create a CDN Profile

1. **Register CDN in subscription**:
   - To register a CDN in my subscription, I first go to the search bar and type 'subscriptions'. I then locate and select the subscription I am using. Next, I search for 'Resource Providers' and select it. After that, I search for 'CDN', where I'm likely to find an option like `Microsoft.CDN`. I select this option and then click 'Register'.

2. **I Create a CDN Profile**:
    - In the Azure Portal, I search for "CDN" and find "Front Door and CDN profiles" click "+Create".
    - I select "Explore other offerings" and "Azure CDN Standard from Microsoft (classic)" 
      
    - I fill in the necessary details, including a unique name `myCDNProfile` for the CDN profile, and select my pricing tier.
    - I finalize the creation of the CDN profile.


### Step 3: Create a CDN Endpoint and Connect to Azure Blob Storage

1. **I Create a CDN Endpoint**:
    - In the newly created CDN profile, I add an endpoint.
    - For the "Origin type," I select "Storage" and choose the `hectorstorage12345` storage account and the specific container I used or created.
    - I complete the setup

-  I click on the Endpoint to copy it's "Endpoint hostname"

- I take the "Endpoint hostname" + `/mycontainer/chest.png` and test in the browser

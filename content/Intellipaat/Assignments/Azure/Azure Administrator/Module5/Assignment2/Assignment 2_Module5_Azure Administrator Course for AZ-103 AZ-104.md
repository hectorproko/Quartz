### Step 1: Create an Azure Container Registry

1. **I Open the Azure Portal**:

2. **I Create the Container Registry**:
    
    - I search for "Container registries" and click "+Create".
    - I fill in the required details, such as the registry name, subscription, resource group, and location.
    - I choose the pricing tier Standard
    - I review and create the container registry.

### Step 2: Connect the Registry to Docker in the VM

hectorregistry
hectorregistry.azurecr.io

1. **I Log into the VM**:
    
    - I SSH into my VM where Docker is installed.
2. **I Log into the Azure Container Registry from the VM**:
    
    - I use the Azure to authenticate to the ACR:
      `az login`

### Step 3: Upload the Image to Azure Container Registry

1. **I Tag the Docker Image**:
    
    - Before pushing the image to ACR, I need to tag it with the ACR login server name:
      <br>![[Pasted image 20231212120337.png]]
      
```bash
docker tag mynewimage:latest <registry_name>.azurecr.io/mynewimage:latest
```

```bash
docker tag hshar/webapp_updated:latest hectorregistry.azurecr.io/webapp_updated:latest
```
<br>![[Pasted image 20231212120520.png]]

2. **I Push the Image to ACR**:
- Login to the container registry
```
sudo az acr login --name hectorregistry
```
<br>![[Pasted image 20231212125808.png]]

- I use the Docker CLI to push the image to the ACR:
```bash
sudo docker push hectorregistry.azurecr.io/webapp_updated:latest
```

Back in the portal I verity the image was uploaded

### Step 4: Create an App Service to Deploy the Image

1. **I Open the Azure Portal Again**:
    
    - I navigate back to the Azure Portal.
2. **I Create a New App Service**:
    
    - I search for "App Services".
    - I click "+ Create" and select "+ Web App".
      <br>![[Pasted image 20231213115310.png]]

    - I fill in the details such as the app name, subscription, resource group, and plan.
    - make sure select right OS Linux and for "Publish" select "Docker Container"
      <br>![[create web app.png]]
      
    - Under "Docker," I select the "Single Container" option.
    - I choose Azure Container Registry as the source and select the image I pushed earlier.
      <br>![[Pasted image 20231213120821.png]]
3. **I Review and Create the Web App**:
    
    - I review all the settings and click "Create" to deploy the web app.
      <br>![[Pasted image 20231213121046.png]]
4. **I Verify the Deployment**:
    - I "Got to resource"
    - Once the app is deployed, I navigate to the URL provided by the App Service.
      <br>![[Pasted image 20231213121214.png]]
    - I should see the application running, served by the Docker image deployed from ACR.

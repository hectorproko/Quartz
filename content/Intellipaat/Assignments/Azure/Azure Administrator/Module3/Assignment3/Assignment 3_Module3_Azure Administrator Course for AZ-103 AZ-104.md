> [!info] Module 3: Assignment - 3
> **Tasks To Be Performed:** 
> 1. Create two storage accounts and create a container inside it 
> 2. Upload some data to the first Blob service 
> 3. Using Data Factory copy data to the second storage serviceâ€™s container

### Step 1: Storage accounts

I navigate to my storage accounts and select two accounts:

1. `hectorstorage12345` will serve as the source account since it already contains data and has a container named `mycontainer`.
    
2. `team1storageaccount54321` will be the destination account."

### Step 2: Upload data
I will choose `hectorstorage12345` as my source account since it already has data and contains a container named `mycontainer`.

### Step 3: Copy Data

I search "Data factories" and click "+Create"

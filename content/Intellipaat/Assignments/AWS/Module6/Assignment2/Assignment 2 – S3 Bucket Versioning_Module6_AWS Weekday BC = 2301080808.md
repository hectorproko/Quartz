> [!info] Module 6: S3 Bucket Versioning
> **Problem Statement:** 
> You work for XYZ Corporation. Their application requires a storage service that can store files and publicly share them if required. Implement S3 for the same. 
> 
> **Tasks To Be Performed:** 
> 1. Enable versioning for the bucket created in task 1. 
> 2. Re-upload any 2 files already uploaded to verify if versioning works.

**Background:** I've already set up an S3 bucket `my-test-bucket-unique-name` and uploaded several files to it, including `document.docx` and `image.jpg`.

### **1. Enabling Versioning for My S3 Bucket:**

**Step 1:** I logged into the AWS Management Console and navigated to the S3 dashboard.

**Step 2:** I clicked on the name of my existing bucket to access its contents.

**Step 3:** I then went to the "Properties" tab to adjust the settings.

**Step 4:** I found the "Versioning" section and clicked on “Edit”.

**Step 5:** I saw the option to enable versioning, so I toggled the switch to "Enable".

**Step 6:** After confirming the change, I saved it to activate versioning for my bucket.

### **2. Re-uploading My Two Files to Verify Versioning:**

**Step 1:** In my bucket, I pressed the “Upload” button to add files.

**Step 2:** I then selected `document.docx` and `image.jpg` from my computer, both of which I had previously modified.

**Step 3:** With the files ready, I clicked the "Upload" button to re-add them to the bucket.

### **3. Checking if Versioning Works:**

**Step 1:** Curious to see if versioning worked, I clicked on the `document.docx`.

**Step 2:** I then navigated to the “Versions” tab in the file's details.

**Step 3:** Just as I hoped, multiple versions of `document.docx` were listed, confirming the versioning feature was active.

**Step 4:** For good measure, I repeated the process with `image.jpg` and saw its multiple versions too.

By following these steps, I successfully enabled versioning for my bucket and verified it worked by re-uploading and checking versions of my previously uploaded files.

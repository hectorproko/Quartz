> [!info] Module 6: Case Study - 1 
> **Problem Statement:** 
> You work for XYZ Corporation. Their application requires a storage service that can store files and publicly share them if required. Implement S3 for the same. 
> 
> **While migrating, you are asked to perform the following tasks:** 
> 1. Ensure that any amount of data can be stored on the cloud and can be retrieved at any time from anywhere on the web. 
> 2. Manage the lifecycle of data that is being stored on the cloud so that it gets automatically deleted after 75 days. 
> 3. Retrieve the old version of a file if the content of the current version of that file is compromised accidently. 
> 4. Host your static website on the AWS cloud using the domain name created in Module 3 assignment. 
> 5. Display an error page if proper domain name is not used while attempting to access the company’s website. 

### **1. Storing and Retrieving Data:**

**Steps I Followed to Create the S3 Bucket:**

1. **Accessing S3**:
- I logged into the AWS Management Console.
- I navigated to the "S3" service under the storage section.
  
2. **Starting the Bucket Creation Process**:
- I clicked on the "Create bucket" button.
  
3. **Configuring General Settings**:
- **Bucket Name**: I designated it as `temp.hectorproko.com`.

> [!tip]
>   When using S3 for static website hosting and Route 53, the bucket name should match the domain/subdomain name you're trying to associate with it.



- **AWS Region**: Retained the default, which was "US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1".
  
4. **Object Ownership Configuration**:
- I selected the "ACLs enabled" option. By enabling ACLs, I granted the flexibility to specify access permissions for the bucket, allowing for actions like "Make public using ACL" at the object level later on.
  
5. **Public Access Configuration**:
- I deselected the "Block all public access" choice.
- I acknowledged the associated warnings by marking the checkbox that reads, "I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public."
  
6. **Activating Bucket Versioning**:
- I turned on "Bucket Versioning". This permits the maintenance of multiple variants of an object within the same bucket.

After ensuring all the settings met my requirements, I finalized by clicking on the "Create bucket" button.

### **2. Managing Lifecycle of Data:**

**Setting Up Auto-Deletion in S3 Bucket:**

**Step 1:** Logged in to AWS, navigate to S3, and selected the desired bucket.

**Step 2:** Clicked the "Management" tab, then "Create lifecycle rule".

**Step 3:** Name the rule "AutoDeleteAfter75Days".

**Step 4:** Choose "Expire current versions of objects" and set to 75 days.

**Step 5:** Save the rule.

### **3. Versioning for File Retrieval:**

When I created the bucket, I enabled "Versioning"

**Demonstrating Versioning in Amazon S3:**

1. Initial Upload:
I created a `.txt` file named `Hello World.txt` with the content "Hello World" and uploaded it to the S3 bucket.

2. Modify and Re-upload:
I then edited the content of the same `.txt` file to "Hello World 2" and uploaded it again.

3. Viewing Versions:
Inside the S3 bucket, I toggled the "Show versions" option. This revealed both the initial and modified versions of the file, each with its unique version ID.

4. Retrieving Content:
By selecting and opening each version, I confirmed that the content corresponds to its respective upload: the older version displays "Hello World" and the newer version displays "Hello World 2".

### **4. Hosting Static Website with Custom Domain:**

**Step 1:** Navigated to the "Properties" tab in your S3 bucket.

**Step 2:** Clicked "Edit" next to  "Static website hosting" .

**Step 3:** Set 'index.html' as the Index document and 'error.html' as the Error document.
<br>![[Pasted image 20230927223731.png]] ^d9a6c3

**Step 5:** Uploaded `index.htm` and `error.html` with the following content:
`index.html`
```html
<h1>Index Page</h1>
```
`error.html`
```html
<h1>Error Page</h1>
```

**Step 5:** Made the static site available to the public, I clicked on 'Actions' and then select 'Make public using ACL'.

**Step 6: Configuring Route 53 to Point to the S3 Static Website**

1. I returned to the **AWS Route 53** service, recalling the setup from [[Assignment 3 – Route 53_Module4_AWS Weekday BC = 2301080808|Assignment 3 – Route 53]].
2. Within Route 53, I navigated to the hosted zone for "temp.hectorproko.com".
3. Here, I initiated the process to define a simple record that would route traffic to the S3 bucket.
4. I left the subdomain field empty to target the root domain.
5. I set the record type as "A" and enabled the alias option.
6. For the "Route traffic to" section, I chose the S3 website endpoint associated with my static site's bucket.
7. After ensuring all details were accurate, I saved my configuration.

With this configuration in place, any visits to "temp.hectorproko.com" will be routed to the static site I've set up in my S3 bucket.

**Step 7: Site Testing:**

1. I accessed `temp.hectorproko.com` and was correctly presented with the **Index Page**.

> [!success]
>    <br>![[Pasted image 20231005225206.png]]

 
2. To simulate an error, I navigated to `temp.hectorproko.com/test` and was appropriately directed to the **Error Page**.

> [!success]
>    <br>![[Pasted image 20231005225134.png]]

Once you've completed these steps, XYZ Corporation's requirements will be fully implemented. The data will be stored securely on AWS, with a lifecycle rule ensuring automatic deletion after 75 days. Additionally, the website will be hosted on AWS, with proper error handling in place.

# Possible Solutions
Follow this tutorial:
[Step 1: Create your file system - Amazon FSx for Windows File Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/getting-started-step1.html)



# 2. Create an FSx file system for Lustre and attach it to an Amazon Linux 2 instance.

### Step 1: Launch FSx for Lustre

1. Navigate to the Amazon FSx service in the AWS Console **Create file System**
2. Select "Amazon FSx for Lustre" and click on it.
    Name it Lustre and picked minimum storage of 1.2TiB
Click Create file system

> [!NOTE]
> VPC Security GroupsInfo
> Specify VPC Security Groups to associate with your file system’s network interface.
> Choose VPC security group(s)
> - sg-e7a6a0dd (default)
>   The VPC Security Groups associated with your file system’s network interfaces must allow inbound Lustre traffic (TCP ports 988, 1018-1023).

> [!attention]
> Might want to harden this

![[Pasted image 20230824145425.png]]
Once available click on it and click Attach to get mount commands

```bash
#Create a new directory
sudo mkdir /fsx
#Mount
sudo mount -t lustre -o noatime,flock fs-0e0819e73ccdda5f1.fsx.us-east-1.amazonaws.com@tcp:/3lm7tbev /fsx
```

---

### Step 3: Network and Security

1. Select the default VPC.
2. Open your machine's security group to edit inbound rules.
    - Add a custom TCP rule to allow inbound traffic on TCP port 988.
    - Add another custom TCP rule to allow port range 1021-1023.
3. Save the changes.


from default VPC's CIDR `172.31.0.0/16`. This is aimed at enabling the instance to communicate with the EFS **mount target**.
Name Lustre
![[lustre security group.png]]

---

### Step 4: EC2 Setup

1. Ensure you have an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux.
   
   attach lustre Security Group
   ![[Pasted image 20230824145106.png]]

1. Connect to your EC2 instance.
2. Update the instance by running `sudo yum update`.
3. Install dependencies needed for FSx for Lustre with the appropriate commands. 
```bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y lustre2.10
```
%%make sure you pick Amazon Linux 2 AMI%%
### Step 5: Attach FSx to EC2

1. Navigate back to the FSx console and click "Attach" on your file system.
2. Copy the provided command to create a directory on your EC2 instance. Run this command.
3. Copy and run the provided command to mount the FSx file system to the directory you created.

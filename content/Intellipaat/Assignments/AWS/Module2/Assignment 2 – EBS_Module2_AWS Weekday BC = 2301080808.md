==PENDING CLEANUP==
 
> [!NOTE]
> **Problem Statement:** 
> You work for XYZ Corporation. Your tnrporation wants to launch a new web-based appliÃ¦tion using AWS Virtual Machines. Configure the resources accMdingly with appropriate storage for the tasks. 
> 
> **Tasks To Be Performed:** 
> 1. Launch a Linux EC2 instance. 
> 2. Create an EBS volume with 20 GB of storage and attach it to the created EC2 instance. 
> 3. Resize the attached volume and make sure it reflects in the connected instance.


I'll log in to my AWS account and go to **EC2 Dashboard** and click **Launch instance**. 
<br>![[Launch instance Button.png]]

I'll named the instance **Assig2** and keep the defaults

To create an **EBS** I'll go to `Elastic Block Store > Volumes > Create volume`
I'll keep the default except for **Size** and click **Create Volume**

The Volume is ready
<br>![[Pasted image 20230822221356.png]]

To attach the volume I select it and in `Actions > Attach volume`

I make sure I select the right instance

I'll connect to the instance using **EC2 Instance Connect** to check the newly attached **Volume** by running `lsblk`

*Shows `xvdf` with expected size of 20GB*

Now we resize the Volume by going back to `Elastic Block Store > Volumes > Actions > Modify volume`.
<br>![[Pasted image 20230822222807.png]]
*We change it to 30Gib*

We wait for the changes to complete. Progress shown in column Volume State.

Then I check again in the EC2 instance

We confirmed the new size is reflected

<!-- This is a comment and won't appear in the reading view 
To reflect the new size in the instance, you may need to resize the filesystem. For an ext4 filesystem, you can use:
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdf

I'll log in to my AWS account and go to **EC2 Dashboard** and click **Launch instance**.

*I happen to be in the correct Region (N. Virginia)*

I'll name my instance **Web_Server**
Pick Ubuntu:

I'll make sure to **Allow** HTTP, HTTPS

In **Advanced details** I'll run some commands in **User data** to make some changes to the page

The full script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update -y

# Install Nginx
apt-get install nginx -y

# Enable and start Nginx service
systemctl enable nginx
systemctl start nginx

# Change the default website content
echo '<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>' > /var/www/html/index.html

# Reload Nginx to pick up the new configuration
systemctl reload nginx
```


I'll wait for instance to be ready

I'll get the instance's **Public IP**  
![[Intellipaat/Assignments/AWS/Module2/images/Others/Pasted image 20230822213826.png]]

When I check in the browser the expected page appears:

### Task 1: Create a Role for VPC and DynamoDB Access

#### Create Policy for Role

First, I started by creating a custom policy that grants complete access to VPCs and DynamoDB. In the IAM dashboard, I clicked on `Policies` and then `Create policy`. I pasted the following JSON in the JSON tab:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
 {
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": [
  "ec2:*",
  "dynamodb:*"
   ],
   "Resource": "*"
 }
  ]
}
```

I reviewed the policy, named it `VPCAndDynamoDBFullAccess`, and then clicked `Create policy`.

#### Create the Role and Attach Policy

Next, I navigated back to the IAM dashboard and clicked on `Roles` followed by `Create role`. 
I selected `AWS account` and checked `This account(XXXXXX)`

It then asks for `Add permissions`, I attached the previously created `VPCAndDynamoDBFullAccess` policy to the role. I reviewed all the settings, gave the role the name `VPC_DynamoDB_Access` and then clicked `Create role`.

**Modifying the Trust Relationship**:
After the role is created, I need to modify its trust relationship to ensure only `User1` and `User2` can assume this role:
- I'll head back to the `Roles` section and click on the role I've just created.
- In the `Trust relationships tab`, I'll click `Edit trust policy`. %%[[Trust Policy_aws|Trust Policy]]%%
- I'll adjust the policy document to the following:

Original: `"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::838427752759:root"`

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::838427752759:user/User1",
                    "arn:aws:iam::838427752759:user/User2"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {}
        }
    ]
}
```

### Task 2: Login into  `User1` and Assume the Role
![[Pasted image 20230922104310.png]]
To test the role, I logged in as  `User1`. 

I tried to create a VPC and a DynamoDB table. However, as **expected**, I could not.

![[Pasted image 20230922104731.png]]

I navigated to the `Switch Role` option in the AWS Management Console. 

![[Pasted image 20230922104516.png]]

I entered the account ID where the role was created and provided the name of the role `VPC_DynamoDB_Access`.

Upon successfully switching roles, I verified my access to VPC and DynamoDB. As expected, I had full permissions to work with both services.

**Extra Testing**:
- I created a new IAM user named `User3`.
- After logging out as `User1`, I signed in as `User3`.
- I navigated to the `Switch Role` option, but I couldn't proceed further. This confirmed that the [[Trust Policy_aws|trust policy]] was working correctly and restricting role assumption to only `User1` and `User2`.

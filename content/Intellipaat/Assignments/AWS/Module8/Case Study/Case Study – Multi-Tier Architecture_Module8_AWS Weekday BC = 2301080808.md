> [!info] Module 8: Case Study - 1
> **Problem Statement:** 
> You work for XYZ Corporation. Your corporation wants to launch a new web-based application. The development team has prepared the code but it is not tested yet. The development team needs the system admins to build a web server to test the code but the system admins are not available. 
> 
> **Tasks To Be Performed:** 
> 1. Web tier: Launch an instance in a public subnet and that instance should allow HTTP and SSH from the internet. 
> 2. Application tier: Launch an instance in a private subnet of the web tier and it should allow only SSH from the public subnet of Web Tier-3. 
> 3. DB tier: Launch an RDS MYSQL instance in a private subnet and it should allow connection on port 3306 only from the private subnet of Application Tier-4. 
> 4. Setup a Route 53 hosted zone and direct traffic to the EC2 instance. 
> 
> **You have been also asked to propose a solution so that:** 
>    1. Development team can test their code without having to involve the system admins and can invest their time in testing the code rather than provisioning, configuring and updating the resources needed to test the code. 
>    2. Make sure when the development team deletes the stack, RDS DB instances should not be deleted.

Used [[Case Study – Database Architecture_Module7_AWS Weekday BC = 2301080808#^787ee9|Case Study – Database Architecture]] as reference mysql-server

had to add a NAT for the instnaces to be able to update install mysql and connect to rds



```bash
mysql -h [RDS_ENDPOINT] -u [USERNAME] -p
```
```bash
chmod +x install_httpd.sh
```
maybe change to ubuntu ami cuse is super slow  amazon linux

==Keep in mind RDS deletion==

Need to compare default VPC and MyVPC

CidrIp: !Ref PrivateSubnetId

However, `PrivateSubnetId` is a reference to a subnet ID, not a CIDR block

Need to  change the nameservers like in  [[Assignment 3 – Route 53_Module4_AWS Weekday BC = 2301080808#^c3e5c2|Assignment 3 – Route 53]]

This template establishes a VPC with two distinct subnets:

- A **Public Subnet** for the web tier, granting direct internet access via an **Internet Gateway**.
- A **Private Subnet** for the app tier, which utilizes a **NAT Gateway** in the public subnet to securely update instances and access the internet.

The infrastructure ensures that the app tier remains isolated while the web tier can be directly accessed from the internet.

This CloudFormation template sets up a multi-tier architecture with clear layers of security and accessibility for a web application. The architecture comprises three main components: a web tier, an application tier, and a database tier.

The **Web Tier** creates an EC2 instance within a specified public subnet. This instance is equipped with a security group that permits incoming HTTP traffic, making it the public-facing component of the architecture. As part of its initialization, this instance installs the Apache2 server, allowing it to host a webpage.

The **Application Tier** establishes another EC2 instance, but this time in a private subnet, reinforcing its isolated nature. It's set up to install a MySQL server upon initialization. The security group associated with this tier only allows SSH traffic, and uniquely, only from the web tier instance. This design ensures that direct external access is restricted, providing an additional layer of security.

Lastly, the **Database Tier** introduces an RDS instance configured for MySQL. It resides within a database subnet group spanning two private subnets. The security group for this RDS instance is designed to only accept connections on the MySQL port from the application tier, thereby ensuring that only the app tier can communicate with the database directly. Importantly, a safeguard has been put in place to ensure that even if the CloudFormation stack is deleted, the RDS DB instance will not be deleted, providing data resilience.

To complete the setup, a Route53 hosted zone and DNS record are created to associate the domain name with the public IP address of the web tier instance, ensuring users can access the hosted page via a friendly domain name.

By structuring the infrastructure in this way, the template promotes a layered security model, ensuring each component is shielded appropriately based on its function and exposure.

### Verifying Web Page Accessibility

The hosted zone in Route 53 has been correctly configured with a record set pointing to the `WebTier` instance - `54.242.228.183`.
![[Pasted image 20231013105213.png]]
When accessing the public IP address `54.242.228.183` directly, the default Apache2 welcome page from an Ubuntu server is displayed, confirming the web server's correct operation.
![[Pasted image 20231013105012.png|460]]
After updating the domain's nameservers in the registrar settings to match those provided by AWS Route 53, navigating to `temp.hectorproko.com` successfully resolves to the Apache2 default page. This confirms that the domain is correctly pointing to the intended web server.

### Testing RDS Connection

From the Web Tier instance with IP ending in `.247`, I initiated an SSH connection to the App Instance:
![[Pasted image 20231012210418.png]]

Upon establishing a successful connection to the App Instance ending in `.67`, I then connected to the RDS instance using its provided endpoint:

> [!success]
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20231012210158.png]]
> The MySQL prompt was displayed, confirming a successful connection to the RDS instance and indicating that all components are functioning as expected.

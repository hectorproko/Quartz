Continuing from [[Assignment 1 – AWS Migration_Module11_AWS Weekday BC = 2301080808|Assignment 1 – AWS Migration]]

### Exporting the Ubuntu Server VM:

1. I open the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager where I can see my "UbuntuDesktop for Migration" VM.
2. I right-click on the VM and select 'Export to OCI'.

3. I follow the prompts and export it in the Open Virtualization Format (OVF).

**Uploading the .OVA to an S3 Bucket:**

4. I log into my AWS Management Console.
5. I navigate to S3 and select existing bucket  `my-test-bucket-unique-name`.
   <br>![[Pasted image 20231015175057.png|400]]
6. I click on 'Upload', select the exported .ova file, and start the upload.

### **Creating the "MigrationRole" in AWS IAM**

1. **Role Creation**:
    - I navigate to the AWS IAM console and select the option to create a new role.
    - Named the role "MigrationRole".
2. **Trust Relationship**:
    - I choose the "Custom trust policy" option.
    - Insert the trust policy with the following details:
	```json
	{
	  "Version": "2012-10-17",
	  "Statement": [
	    {
	      "Effect": "Allow",
	      "Principal": {
	        "Service": "vmie.amazonaws.com"
	      },
	      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
	    }
	  ]
	}
	```
   - This trust policy allows the "vmie.amazonaws.com" service (Virtual Machine Import/Export) to assume this role. This service is used for tasks like converting `.ova` files to Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).
3. **Permission Policies**:
  - Attach the following AWS managed policies to the role:
      - `AmazonEC2FullAccess`: This provides full access to all EC2 actions and resources.
      - `AmazonS3FullAccess`: This grants full access to S3 actions and resources, allowing for storage operations which might be necessary during migrations.

### **Using AWS CLI:**

1. **I've already installed the AWS CLI.**
   [Installing intructions](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
2. **Now, I'll generate an access key for AWS CLI use:**
    - I navigate to the AWS Management Console.
    - I click on my account (e.g., `hrodGmail`) at the top right.
    - In the dropdown, I select "Security credentials."
      <br>![[Pasted image 20231019142304.png]]
    - Under "Access keys," I click on "Create access key."
      <br>![[Pasted image 20231019142209.png]]

3. **After receiving the keys, I configure the AWS CLI:**
    - I run the command: `aws configure`
    - I enter the provided AWS Access Key ID.
    - I enter the AWS Secret Access Key.
    - I set the default region to `us-east-1`.
    - I leave the default output format as it is.
      
4. **To verify the connection, I list the S3 buckets:**
    - I run the command: `aws s3 ls`
      
<br>![[Pasted image 20231019142746.png]]


5. I create a new file named `container.json` with the following content:
	```json
	[
	  {
	    "Description": "Ubuntu Server OVA to AMI",
	    "Format": "ova",
	    "UserBucket": {
	      "S3Bucket": "my-test-bucket-unique-name",
	      "S3Key": "UbuntuServer.ova"
	    }
	  }
	]
	```

### Creating an AMI from the OVA:

1. To initiate the import of the OVA image into an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), I run the following command:

	```
	aws ec2 import-image --disk-containers "file://C:\Users\Hecti\Downloads\container.json" --role MigrationRole
	```
	
	<br>![[Pasted image 20231019150718.png]]

2. To monitor the progress of the image import task and obtain its status, I use:
	```
	aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks --import-task-ids "import-ami-0faf4b221ede0a163"
	```
	
	<br>![[Pasted image 20231019150823.png]]
	*The progress was at `39%` when I last checked.*


After the process completes, I receive a snapshot.
<br>![[Pasted image 20231019151924.png]]

The AWS VM Import/Export service processed my disk image, took a snapshot, and subsequently generated an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from that snapshot.
<br>![[Pasted image 20231019161606.png]]

The name of the AMI is `import-ami-0faf4b221ede0a163`.


**Launching an EC2 Instance using the AMI:**

Using this AMI, I launch an EC2 instance by clicking the button "Launch instance from AMI". When setting it up, I ensure to use the .pem file for authentication.

To access the EC2 instance, I use SSH with the username 'hector'. This username was established when I initially installed the operating system in VirtualBox.

The command I use is:
```bash
ssh hector@ec2-54-80-238-211.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

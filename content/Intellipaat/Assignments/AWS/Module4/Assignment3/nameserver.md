*The term "nameserver" specifically denotes a server responsible for handling domain name resolution within the context of the [[DNS (Domain Name System)|DNS]].*

A **nameserver** can be defined as:

"A nameserver is a specialized server on the Internet that handles queries or questions from your local computer, about the location of a domain name's various services. It is a vital component of the Domain Name System (DNS) that translates domain names, which can be easily remembered by humans, into IP addresses, which are used for routing data packets on the Internet."

In simpler terms:

A nameserver is like a phonebook for the Internet. When you type in a web address (like "example.com"), your computer asks the nameserver, "Where can I find 'example.com'?" and the nameserver provides the corresponding IP address, guiding your computer to the right location on the Internet.

Nameservers themselves have domain names and are associated with IP addresses. For example, a nameserver for a domain might be `ns1.examplehost.com`, and this nameserver will contain the authoritative DNS records for various domain names managed under it.

1. **Function**: A hosted zone in Route 53 is a container of information about how you want to route traffic on the internet for a specific domain, like `example.com`, and possibly its subdomains.
    
2. **Role**: Once you have a domain (from any registrar), you'll need a way to manage and serve the DNS records for that domain. That's what a hosted zone in Route 53 does. It allows you to set up DNS records like A, CNAME, MX, etc., which determine how traffic to your domain is handled (e.g., which IP it points to, mail server configurations, aliases, etc.).
    
3. **Relationship with Domain Registrars**: If you buy a domain from a registrar other than Route 53, you would typically get default nameservers from that registrar. If you decide to use Route 53 to manage the DNS records for that domain, you would create a hosted zone in Route 53. Route 53 will then provide you with a set of its nameservers (NS records). You'd then update your domain at your original registrar to use these Route 53 nameservers, effectively delegating the DNS management of that domain to Route 53.

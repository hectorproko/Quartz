> [!info] Module 4: Route 53 Assignment
> **Problem Statement:** 
> You work for XYZ Corporation that uses on premise solutions and some limited number of systems. With the increase in requests in their application, the load also increases. So, to handle the load the corporation has to buy more systems almost on a regular basis. Realizing the need to cut down the expenses on systems, they decided to move their infrastructure to AWS. 
> 
> **Tasks To Be Performed:**
> 1. Use the Route 53 hosted zone created in the assignment. 
> 2. Route the traffic to an EC2 instance with an Apache web server running in it using its IP address.


### Created an EC2 instance with a Web Server:


1. Launched the EC2 Instance Noted the Public IP.

2. Installed the Web Server 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Update the package manager
sudo yum update
# Install the Apache web server
sudo yum install httpd -y
# Start the Apache web server
sudo systemctl start httpd
# Create a web page
echo "Hello from Web Server!" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
# Restart the Apache web server
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```
3. Testing.

### Created a Hosted Zone in Route 53:

1. Opened the **Route 53 console** in the AWS Management Console.
2. In the left navigation pane, clicked on "Hosted zones".
3. Clicked the "Create hosted zone" button.
4. In the "Create Hosted Zone" form:
    - **Domain Name**: Entered my domain name `temp.hectorproko.com`.
    - **Type**: Selected "Public Hosted Zone".
5. Clicked "Create".

After creating the hosted zone, Route 53 provides me with a set of **NS (Name Server) records**. We'll need to update out domain registrar's nameserver settings with these NS records to delegate the domain's DNS to Route 53.

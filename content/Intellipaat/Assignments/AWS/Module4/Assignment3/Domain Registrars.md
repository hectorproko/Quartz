1. **Function**: A domain registrar is a service where you can purchase and register domain names, like `example.com`.
    
2. **Role**: Once you register a domain name, the domain registrar will make an entry into a global centralized database known as the Domain Name System (DNS). This entry tells the world that the domain `example.com` is owned by you and provides information about how to resolve it (i.e., which nameservers to use).
    
3. **Popular Registrars**: Some well-known domain registrars include GoDaddy, Namecheap, Bluehost, and many others. AWS Route 53 also acts as a domain registrar, meaning you can buy domains directly through AWS.

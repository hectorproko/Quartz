> [!info] Assignment 1 – ELB Assignment
> **Problem Statement:** 
> You work for XYZ Corporation that uses on premise solutions and some limited number of systems. With the increase in requests in their application, the load also increases. So, to handle the load the corporation has to buy more systems almost on a regular basis. Realizing the need to cut down the expenses on systems, they decided to move their infrastructure to AWS. 
> 
> **Tasks To Be Performed:** 
> 1. Create a Classic Load Balancer and register 3 EC2 instances with different web pages running in them. 
> 2. Migrate the Classic Load Balancer into an Application Load Balancer.


### Creation of the Three EC2 Instances:
Created 3 EC2 instances with the following:

- **Security Group Attached**: 
  I attached a security group to each of the three instances that allows HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH from all sources.

- **Commands Executed on Each EC2 Instance**:
  
```bash
# Update the package manager
sudo yum update
# Install the Apache web server
sudo yum install httpd -y
# Start the Apache web server
sudo systemctl start httpd
# Create a web page
echo "Hello from Instance1!" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
# Restart the Apache web server
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

Changed: `"Hello from Instance[1,2,3]!"` for each instance


### Creating a Classic Load Balancer:

1. **Open AWS Management Console**:
   - I'll log into my AWS account and go to the EC2 dashboard.

2. **Start Creating the Classic Load Balancer**:
   - Under the `Load Balancers` section, I'll click on `Create Load Balancer`.
  - I'll choose `Classic Load Balancer` and hit `Create`.

3. **Set Up the Load Balancer**:
 - I'll give it a unique name.
 - I'll ensure it's in my desired VPC and Mappings `us-east-1a (use1-az6)` is selected since my EC2s are in Availability Zone `us-east-1a`.
 - Under `Listeners and routing`, I'll ensure HTTP is set up.

4. **Assigning Security Groups**: 
 - I'll click "Next: Assign Security Groups".
 - I'll select the security group I previously created that allows HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH.

5. **Configure Health Checks**: 
 - I'll set the Ping Protocol to HTTP, Ping Port to 80, and Ping Path to `/index.html`.

6. **Adding My EC2 Instances**:
 - I'll click on `Add instances`.
 - I'll select the three instances I set up manually.

7. **Finalize Creation**:
 - I'll review everything and click `Create load balancer`.

When I open the browser using the DNS name of the load balancer, I see that it hits all three servers.

> [!info] Module 5: VPC Peering Assignment
> **Problem Statement:** 
> Working for an organization, you are required to provide them a safe and secure environment for the deployment of their resources. They might require different types of connectivity. Implement the following to fulfill the requirements of the company. 
> 
> **Tasks To Be Performed:** 
> 1. Create 2 VPCs in the North Virginia region named `MYVPC1` and `MYVPC2` 
> 2. Create one VPC in the Oregon region named `VPCOregon1` 
> 3. Create a peering connection between `MYVPC1` and `MYVPC2` 
> 4. Create a peering connection between `MYVPC2` and `VPCOregon1` 


### Step 1: Create the VPCs

1. **I'll log in to the AWS Management Console:**
  - I'll open my web browser.
  - I'll navigate to the AWS Management Console and sign in.

2. **Next, I'll navigate to the VPC Dashboard:**
  - In the AWS Services search bar, I'll type "VPC" and select the "VPC" service.

3. **I'll then create `MYVPC1` in North Virginia:**
  - I'll make sure my region is set to North Virginia (us-east-1).
  - On the VPC Dashboard, I'll click on "Your VPCs".
  - I'll click "Create VPC".
  - I'll name it `MYVPC1` and set the CIDR block as `10.0.1.0/24`.
  - I'll click "Create".

4. **Now, I'll create `MYVPC2` in North Virginia:**
  - I'll follow the same process, naming it `MYVPC2` with the CIDR block `10.0.2.0/24`.

5. **I'll switch to the Oregon region to create `VPCOregon1`:**
  - I'll change my region to Oregon (us-west-2) at the top right corner of the AWS console.
  - Again, I'll follow the VPC creation process, naming it `VPCOregon1` with the CIDR block `10.0.3.0/24`.

### Step 2: Set up VPC Peering Connections

1. **I'll set up peering between `MYVPC1` and `MYVPC2`:**
  
  - I'll make sure my region is still set to North Virginia (us-east-1).
  - On the VPC Dashboard, I'll go to "Peering connections".
  - I'll click " Create peering connection".
  - I'll name the connection `Peering-MYVPC1-MYVPC2`.
  - For "Requester VPC", I'll choose `MYVPC1`.
  - For "Accepter VPC", I'll choose `MYVPC2`.
    <br>![[Pasted image 20230925161831.png]]
  - I'll click "Create peering connection".
  - After creating, I'll select the new peering connection, click "Actions", and choose "Accept Request".
 
2. **Next, I'll set up peering between `MYVPC2` and `VPCOregon1`:**
  
  - Staying in North Virginia (us-east-1), I'll go to "Peering Connections".
  - I'll click "Create Peering Connection".
  - I'll name it `Peering-MYVPC2-VPCOregon1`.
  - For "Requester VPC", I'll choose `MYVPC2`.
  - I'll change the region for "Accepter" to Oregon (us-west-2) and select `VPCOregon1`.
  - I'll click " Create peering connection".
  - Now, I'll switch my region to Oregon (us-west-2), find my peering connection, click "Actions", and choose "Accept Request".

### Step 3: Update Route Tables

To ensure the VPCs can communicate, I'll update their route tables:

1. In the VPC Dashboard, I'll go to "Route tables".
2. I'll select the route table associated with each VPC.
3. Under the "Routes" tab, I'll click "Edit routes".
4. I'll add new routes:
  - For `MYVPC1`, I'll point to `MYVPC2`'s CIDR block using the peering connection.
    - In the "Destination" field, I'll enter the CIDR block of `MYVPC2` `10.0.2.0/24`.
    - In the "Target" dropdown, I'll select "Peering Connection" and then select the peering connection between `MYVPC1` and `MYVPC2` from the list.
      <br>![[Pasted image 20230925181241.png]]
  - For `MYVPC2`, I'll point to both `MYVPC1` and `VPCOregon1`'s CIDR blocks using their respective peering connections.
    `MYVPC1`:
    - For "Destination", I'll enter the CIDR block of `MYVPC1` (`10.0.1.0/24`).
    - In "Target", I'll select "Peering Connection" and choose the peering connection
      <br>![[Pasted image 20230925180309.png]]
    `VPCOregon1`:
    - For "Destination", I'll enter the CIDR block of `VPCOregon1` (`10.0.3.0/24`).
    - In "Target", I'll select "Peering Connection" and choose the peering connection between `MYVPC2` and `VPCOregon1`.
      <br>![[Pasted image 20230925180455.png]]
  - For `VPCOregon1`, I'll point to `MYVPC2`'s CIDR block using the peering connection.
    - For "Destination", I'll enter the CIDR block of `MYVPC2` `10.0.2.0/24`.
    - In "Target", I'll select "Peering Connection" and then choose the peering connection between `MYVPC2` and `VPCOregon1` from the list.
      <br>![[Pasted image 20230925175638.png]]
5. I'll save these routes.

Once I've completed these steps, the VPCs should be interconnected as intended. %%Additionally, I'll remember to configure security groups and network ACLs to manage traffic appropriately.%%

What i had to do just to test this connectivity

To ensure functional instances and allow SSH access from the internet, I had to create subnets, internet gateways, and route table entries. Additionally, I attached the internet gateway to the VPC and then associated it with the subnet. This setup was crucial for enabling direct access to the instances over the internet.

%%

> [!summary]
> Given AWS's VPC peering model, the inability of `insta1` in `MYVPC1` to ping `insta3` in `VPCOregon1` was <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">expected</mark>. Transitive peering isn't supported by AWS. Even though there's a peering connection between `MYVPC1` and `MYVPC2`, and another one between `MYVPC2` and `VPCOregon1`, it doesn't automatically facilitate traffic flow from `MYVPC1` directly to `VPCOregon1` via `MYVPC2`.
> 
> For direct communication between `insta1` and `insta3`, a peering connection between `MYVPC1` and `VPCOregon1` is required. This understanding is based on the inherent characteristics of AWS VPC peering. Adjustments to the route tables would follow suit once a direct peering connection is in place.

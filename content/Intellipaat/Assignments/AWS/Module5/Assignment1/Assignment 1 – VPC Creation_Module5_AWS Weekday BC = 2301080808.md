> [!info] Module 5: VPC Creation Assignment
> **Problem Statement:** 
> Working for an organization, you are required to provide them a safe and secure environment for the deployment of their resources. They might require different types of connectivity. Implement the following to fulfill the requirements of the company. 
> 
> **Tasks To Be Performed:** 
> 1. Create a VPC with 120.0.0.0/16 CIDR block. 
> 2. Create 1 public subnet 2 private subnets and make sure you connect a NAT gateway for internet connectivity to a private subnet.


## 1. **Setting up the VPC**:

1. **Access AWS Management Console**: Open up my AWS Console and navigate to the VPC Dashboard.
2. **Begin VPC Creation**: Click on "Your VPCs", and then “Create VPC”.
3. **VPC Configuration**:
 - **Name**: I'll label it for easy identification `Assignment1`.
 - **CIDR block**: Input `120.0.0.0/16`.
 - Clicked on “Create VPC” to finalize the VPC.

## 2. **Defining Subnets**:

### 2.1. **Public Subnet**:

1. **Initiate Subnet Creation**: Under the VPC Dashboard, I'll go to “Subnets” and select “Create subnet”.
2. **Configuration**:
 - **VPC**: Selected the VPC I just created `Assignment1`.
  ![[Pasted image 20230925115628.png]]
 - **Name**: Labeled it "Public-Subnet".
 - **CIDR block**: Entered "120.0.0.0/24".
 - **Availability Zone**: Chose `us-east-1a`.
3. **Finalize**: Clicked “Create subnet”.
 
### 2.2. **Private Subnets**:

1. **First Private Subnet**:
 - **Name**: Label it "Private-Subnet-1".
 - **CIDR block**: Use "120.0.1.0/24".
 - **Availability Zone**: Chose `us-east-1b`. 
  Click “Create subnet”.
2. **Second Private Subnet**:
 - **Name**: Label it "Private-Subnet-2".
 - **CIDR block**: Use "120.0.2.0/24".
 - **Availability Zone**: Chose `us-east-1c`. 
  Click “Create subnet”.

## 3. **Facilitating Internet Access**:

1. **Create Internet Gateway**:
 - Under "Internet gateways" in the VPC Dashboard, clicked “Create internet gateway”.
 - **Name**: Label it for identification `Assignment1`.
 - **Attach**: Attached this gateway to the VPC I created earlier.
  
2. **Update Route Table for Public Subnet**:
 - I'll go to “Route tables”.
 - Edit the route table associated with the public subnet.
  ![[Pasted image 20230925122901.png]]
 - Add a rule to allow traffic to "0.0.0.0/0" through the internet gateway.

## 4. **Ensuring Private Subnet Connectivity via NAT**:

1. **NAT Gateway Creation**:
 - Navigated to "NAT Gateways" and clicked "Create NAT gateway".
 - **Subnet**: Place it in the public subnet for internet access.
 - **Allocate new EIP**: To ensure the NAT gateway has a public IP allocated an Elastic IP by clicking `Allocate Elastic IP`.

2. **Update Private Subnet Route Table**:

	**Observation**: Both my public and private subnets are currently sharing the default route table that came bundled with the VPC. This isn't the setup I want.
	
	**Intended Action**: I'm going to isolate the private subnets by setting up a distinct route table for them. This way, I can manage their routing independently and maintain clarity in my VPC structure.
	
	**Steps I'll Take**:
	1. **Craft a New Route Table for My Private Subnets**:
	 - I'll head over to the VPC Dashboard.
	 - I'll click on "Route Tables" option on the left.
	 - I'll click “Create route table” button.
	 - I'll give it a descriptive name "PrivateSubnetsRouteTable".
	 - I'll ensure it's associated with my VPC by selecting it from the dropdown.
	  
	2. **Adjust the Route to Point to the NAT Gateway**:
	 - Now, in the details of this fresh route table, I'll head to the “Routes” section.
	 - I need to point all outbound traffic to the NAT gateway, so I'll add a route:
	  - For `Destination`, I'll enter `0.0.0.0/0`.
	  - For `Target`, I'll pick the NAT gateway from the list.
	   ![[Pasted image 20230925132355.png]]
	 - That's done. I'll save the changes.
	  
	3. **Link My Private Subnets to This New Table**:
	 - Staying in the details of this route table, I'll navigate to “Actions”.
	 - I'll click on “Edit subnet associations” option.
	  ![[Pasted image 20230925133134.png]]
	 - From the list, I'll tick the boxes next to my private subnets and click "Save associations"


> [!success] Final Check
> Before concluding, I'll ensure all configurations are correct and perform a connectivity test from the private subnet, ensuring the NAT gateway is working as expected.
> 
> **Initial Access to the Public Subnet Instance**:
> 
>  - I SSHed into the EC2 instance residing in the public subnet.
>   
> **Connectivity Test to Private Instance**:
>  
>  - Before attempting to ping the private instance, I realized that I needed to allow ICMP traffic to test the connection between the two instances.
>   
>  - I modified the security group of the private instance to allow inbound ICMP traffic from the public subnet's IP range.
>   
>  - I successfully pinged the private subnet instance from my public instance:
> 
> ```bash
> [ec2-user@ip-120-0-0-226 ~]$ ping 120.0.2.139
> 64 bytes from 120.0.2.139: icmp_seq=170 ttl=127 time=1.06 ms
> ...
> ```
> 
> **Preparing for SSH into Private Instance**:
>  
>  - To SSH into the private instance from the public instance, I needed the private key for the private instance.
>  - I securely transferred and stored this key temporarily on the public instance as `temp_key`.
>   
> **SSH into the Private Subnet Instance**:
>  
>  - Using the transferred key, I initiated an SSH connection from the public instance to the private instance:
> 
> ```bash
> [ec2-user@ip-120-0-0-226 ~]$ ssh -i temp_key ec2-user@120.0.2.139
> [ec2-user@ip-120-0-2-139 ~]$
> ```
>   
> **Testing Internet Connectivity from Private Instance**:
>  
>  - To validate that the private instance had outbound internet access via the NAT gateway, I pinged Google's public DNS server:
>   
> ```bash
> [ec2-user@ip-120-0-2-139 ~]$ ping 8.8.8.8
> 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=50 time=2.49 ms
> ...
> ```
>   
>  - The successful ping confirmed that my private instance had correct outbound internet connectivity.

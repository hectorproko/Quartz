%%Referencing [[zoom video#Assignment 3]]%%

### Step 1:
Continuing from [[Assignment 2 – Kubernetes_Module 7_Devops BC = 2330070508|Assignment 2 – Kubernetes]]

> [!tip] Instances and Their Private IP Addresses
> k-master: `10.0.1.82`
> worker1: `10.0.1.57`
> worker2: `10.0.1.119`
> 

### Step 2: Change Replicas
At the moment our deployments have 3 replicas each.

I run the command `kubectl edit deploy` which opens the deployment configuration in a command-line editor. Within this editor, which operates similarly to Vim, I modify the number of `replicas` to scale the deployment.

After editing, I save the changes using the editor's save and exit commands `:wq`

After saving the updated deployment configuration, I confirm the changes by checking the status of deployments

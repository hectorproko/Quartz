### Windows

1. **Downloading Terraform**
   First, I head over to the official Terraform website to grab the latest version. In the downloads section, I select the `Windows_AMD64` option, since that matches my system's architecture. Clicking the link initiates the download of a `.zip` file.

2. **Extracting the Terraform Executable**
   Once the download finishes, I find the `.zip` file in my Downloads folder. I right-click on it and choose `Extract All...`, which reveals the `terraform.exe` within. I decide to keep it simple and leave `terraform.exe` right there in the Downloads folder for now.

3. **Setting Up the Environment Variable**

4. **Testing the Terraform Command**
   To check if everything's working, I open a new Command Prompt window and type `terraform --version`.

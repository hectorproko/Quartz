1. **I create a new folder**:

```bash
mkdir GitAssignment
```

2. **I navigate to the new folder**:

```bash
cd GitAssignment
```

3. **I create the required files in this folder**:

```bash
touch Code.txt Log.txt Output.txt
```

4. **I initialize a new Git repository in this folder**:

```bash
git init
```

5. **I stage `Code.txt` and `Output.txt` for the commit**:

```bash
git add Code.txt Output.txt
```

6. **I commit the staged files with a message**:

```bash
git commit -m "I added Code.txt and Output.txt files"
```

7. **I have already set up the remote repository**:
  - I've previously created a repository on GitHub named `GitAssignment`.
  - I've also configured SSH, enabling me to clone and push to the repository without entering my credentials each time.

8. **I link my local repository to the remote GitHub repository**:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:hectorproko/GitAssignment.git
```

9. **I rename the default branch to `main`**:

```bash
git branch -M main
```
*GitHub repository's default branch is already named `main`*

10. **I push my commit to the remote GitHub repository**:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

> [!success]
> Now, I've successfully added my files to the GitHub repository.

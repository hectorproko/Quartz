```
echo "Content of master.txt" > master.txt
git add master.txt
git commit -m "Added master.txt to master branch"
```

### Step 2: 
Create 3 branches: public 1, public 2, and private
```
git branch public1
git branch public2
git branch private
```

### Step 3:

The `Fast-forward` indicates that `private` simply moved forward to the latest commit of `master`. As a result, the file `public1.txt` was added to the `private` branch.

ðŸš€ **Docker Assignment Mastery: Crafting a Custom Dockerfile!** In my latest DevOps training, I completed an assignment that involved creating a Dockerfile to build a custom Docker image. The task required setting up an Ubuntu container with Apache2 installed and ensuring Apache2 runs automatically when the container starts. This exercise enhanced my Dockerfile crafting skills, teaching me efficient image building practices and the nuances of container configuration. Successfully completing this task demonstrated my growing proficiency in Docker, a critical tool in the DevOps toolkit.

> [!info] Module 3: Docker Part 1 Assignment - 4
> **Tasks To Be Performed:** 
> 1. Create a Dockerfile with the following specs:
>   - Ubuntu container
>   - Apache2 installed
>   - Apache2 should automatically run once the container starts 
> 2. Submit the Dockerfile for assignment completion

**Dockerfile:**
```Dockerfile
# Using the Ubuntu base image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Updating the package list and installing Apache2
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install apache2

# Exposing port 80 for Apache2
EXPOSE 80

# Command to run Apache2 in the foreground
CMD ["apachectl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```

1. I chose to use the `ubuntu:latest` tag to ensure I'm using the latest version of the Ubuntu image.
2. I combined the `RUN` commands into one line to make the image more efficient by reducing the number of layers.
3. I decided to go with `CMD` instead of `ENTRYPOINT` for starting Apache. This gives me the flexibility to override the command if needed when running the container in the future.

title: Containerizing Apache on Ubuntu
---
<!--
ðŸš€ **Case Study Achievement: Docker Containerization for Production Environment!** In a comprehensive case study for my DevOps training, I successfully Dockerized a custom software application for a production server. The task involved creating an Ubuntu container with Apache installed, managing the Dockerfile for code integration, and pushing the custom container to Docker Hub. This assignment provided me with in-depth exposure to Docker in a real-world application scenario, enhancing my skills in containerization and deployment of custom software solutions using Docker.

> [!NOTE] Module 3: Case Study - Containerization using Docker Part 1 
> **Problem Statement:** 
> You work as a DevOps Engineer in a leading software company. You have been asked to Dockerize the applications on the production server. The company uses custom software. Therefore, there is no pre-built container which can be used. 
> 
> Assume the following things: 
> 1. Assume the software to be installed is Apache 
> 2. Use an Ubuntu container 
> 
> The company wants the following things: 
> 1. Push a container to Docker Hub with the above config 
> 2. The developers will not be working with Docker, hence from their side you will just get the code. Write a Dockerfile which could put the code in the custom image that you have built.


I'll use [[Assignment 5 â€“ Docker â€“ I_Module 3_Devops BC = 2330070508|Assignment 5 â€“ Docker â€“ I]] with the additional step of pushing to DockerHub.
<br>![[Assignment 5 â€“ Docker â€“ I_Module 3_Devops BC = 2330070508#Steps]]

When the developer provides the code, which will likely consist of multiple files, I can update the Dockerfile to incorporate this new code. Then, I'll rebuild the image.
```Dockerfile
# Copy developer code into the appropriate directory in the container 
COPY website/ /var/www/html/
```

Similarly to what I did in [[Assignment 3 â€“ Docker â€“ I_Module 3_Devops BC = 2330070508|Assignment 3 â€“ Docker â€“ I]], I'll then upload the rebuilt image to DockerHub.

I tag the image with my Docker Hub username and desired repository name (I'll use ```my_docker_image``` as an example):
```
docker tag my_apache_image2:latest hectorproko/my_docker_image:my_apache_image2
```

Now, I push the tagged image to Docker Hub:
```
docker push hectorproko/my_docker_image:my_apache_image2
```

# LOAD-BALANCER-SOLUTION-WITH-NGINX-AND-SSL-TLS
PROJECT 10: LOAD BALANCER SOLUTION WITH NGINX AND SSL/TLS

To know different alternative solutions for the same problem. We will implement a **Nginx Load Balancing** Web Solution with secured HTTPS connection with periodically updated SSL/TLS certificates.

In this project we will register our website with LetsEnrcypt Certificate Authority, to automate certificate issuance and use a shell client recommended by LetsEncrypt â€“ certbot.
